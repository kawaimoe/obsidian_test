## 3.5: Host-Based Firewalls

Can be used to:

- Monitor for blocked connections:Â 
    - set firewalls to log for all attempted connections made that are not listed on firewall rules
    - this can prevent recon/lateral movement post-comprimise
- Identifying Listening applications:
    - after making a baseline for all apps that 'should' have a network connection, set up logging for all new connections - never seen before - that have made a network connection.
- Keep full connection logs:
    - generate a log file that can be used for forensics/IA after detection/alert
- Also it is low budget, requires no extra agents or tools (relying on OS defaults windows/linux)
