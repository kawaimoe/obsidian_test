Useful to set baseline for:

- what systems service accounts should be logging in to
- what is the habit of an average user (good for detecting abnormal behaviourÂ 

Useful to monitor:

- login type
- type of account (user-computer-service)
- how many machines per account
- local to local account use (pass-the-token)
- Login failure
    - if service account login fails, this is suspect
    - if multiple failed logins on one user: brute forcing
    - multiple logins failures from different accounts on single machine: password spraying
