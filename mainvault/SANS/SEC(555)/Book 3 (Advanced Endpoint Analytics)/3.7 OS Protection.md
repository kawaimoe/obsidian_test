protection for kernal processes and memory per process and or application 

Windows: EMET

- currently backed into windows exploit protection
- great for older systems without newer security features
- enables logging when a process malfeasance is detected whereas without EMET logging is not enabled

Linux: grsecurity

- open-source EMET alternative for linux
- labour intensive and requires kernal patching 
- can break systems, but better than not having it for some systems
